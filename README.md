# Dual-Image-Super-Resolution-for-High-Resolution-Optical-Satellite-Image
This project implements a dual-input super-resolution network that enhances low-resolution (LR) satellite images into high-resolution (HR) outputs using concatenation-based feature fusion and an EDSR backbone.
The model is built and trained in PyTorch using the Proba-V dataset, which provides multi-temporal low-resolution satellite imagery with corresponding high-resolution references.

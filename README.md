# Dual-Image-Super-Resolution-for-High-Resolution-Optical-Satellite-Image
This project implements a dual-input super-resolution network that enhances low-resolution (LR) satellite images into high-resolution (HR) outputs using concatenation-based feature fusion and an EDSR backbone.
The model is built and trained in PyTorch using the Proba-V dataset, which provides multi-temporal low-resolution satellite imagery with corresponding high-resolution references.

## Overview

This project targets the problem of enhancing the spatial resolution of satellite images captured at different times. Since high-res satellites are costly and limited, we leverage **multiple low-resolution inputs** captured over time to reconstruct the corresponding high-resolution image.

This approach is especially useful for missions like **Proba-V**, where the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution limits imagery quality.

##📊 Evaluation Metrics

The performance is evaluated using:

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**

Higher values indicate better reconstruction.
